Dear {{ name }},

You are receiving this email because you have a registered account on
KA Lite Central Server or "Online Hub".

Since the launch of our second generation platform, Kolibri, in
December 2017, Learning Equality has stopped actively developing
KA Lite. While the platform is still available for use, we will be
discontinuing the ability to sync data to the KA Lite Central Server.
This means that any data you have on the KA Lite Central Server will no
longer be retrievable as of March 1, 2020.  

If you want access to this data, we strongly encourage you to
*retrieve and export* any data from your synced deployments
*by March 1, 2020*. It will not be available after this date, and we
will not be able to support you in accessing your data. You can login
and download your data. Instructions are available here:

https://kalite.learningequality.org/


We would like to hear about your experiences with KA Lite so please:

 - Share your story on the Community Forum:
   https://community.learningequality.org/c/success-stories

 - Add yourself to the KA Lite map:
   https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/


This will also help the continued evolution of our work to support our
learners. As part of this change, we also recommend that you start to
consider and plan your transition from KA Lite to Kolibri. Kolibri is
built on years of lessons and feedback from KA Lite. Beyond having
feature parity and Khan Academy videos and exercises, it also has a
larger library of content, additional pedagogical support to educators
to support just-in-time pedagogy, and tools for differentiated
learning. And like KA Lite, it is free, Open Source and available for
use offline.

Again, we strongly encourage you to download your data from the KA Lite
Central Server as it will no longer be available after March 1, 2020.
If you do require a similar central data syncing service, please
contact us via info@learningequality.org, so we can best assess your
needs and how we can support.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused as a result of this change,
but we strongly believe that the shift to Kolibri will better support
learners in the long-run. If you have any questions, we encourage you
to post in the relevant discussion pages on our Community Forum about
KA Lite and/or Kolibri:

With our warmest regards,
The Learning Equality team
