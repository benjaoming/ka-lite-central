Dear {{ name }},

This email is sent to you, as you have registered an account on KA Lite’s
“Central Server” or “Hub”.

As you may already know, since the launch of our second generation platform
Kolibri [1], in December 2017, we have stopped actively developing KA Lite. 

During 2020, Now, in 2020, wwe will gradually shut be shutting down the KA Lite
Central Serveronline hub. We have disabled new account registration, and
*on March 1st 2020, we will disable data export*. Therefore, you should export
any data you may need now. You can login and download your data here:

https://kalite.learningequality.org/


But please don't freight, you will still be able to continue using KA Lite,
shall you choose to. The only thing that is changing is the action of syncing
data to KA Lite's Central Server. 

However, our recommendation is that all users transition to Kolibri, since
KA Lite will soon become obsolete, once all updates on Khan Academy content will
be done in Kolibri.

Kolibri is also free and Open Source, it has everything that KA Lite has, and
much, much more: same Khan Academy videos and exercises, but with a larger
content library, with resources in many more languages, grades and subjects, a
Coach Dashboard that allows for real-time pedagogy, with notifications, lessons
and assessment creation, and tools for differentiated learning, all for offline
use. You can learn more here, and download Kolibri here:

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate in contacting us via our
Community Forum [2]. We would very much like to hear about your experiences with
KA Lite. You can share your story on the forum and/or add yourself to the
KA Lite map [3]!
