Dear {{ name }},

We have disconnected the main components of KA Lite's Central Server. It allowed
users to aggregate data from KA Lite devices, which could operate in an offline
environment and upon online access sync data "up" and "down" to the
Central Server:

- Learner and coach data
- Exercise attempt logs
- Video logs
- Device logs
- Rating logs
