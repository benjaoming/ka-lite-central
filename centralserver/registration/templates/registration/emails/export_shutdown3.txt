Dear {{ name }},

You are receiving this reminder email, because you have a registered
account on KA Lite's "Central Server" or "Hub", a data syncing service
that is about to be discontinued. Please read on:

Since the launch of our second generation platform, Kolibri
(learningequality.org/kolibri), in December 2017, Learning Equality has
stopped actively developing KA Lite. While KA Lite is still available
for use, we will be discontinuing the ability to sync data to the KA
Lite Central Server, and are encouraging users to start the transition
to Kolibri. This means that any data you have on the KA Lite Central
Server will no longer be retrievable as of *March 1, 2020*.

If you want access to this data, we strongly encourage you to retrieve
and export any data from your synced deployments by *March 1, 2020*. It
will not be available after this date, and we will not be able to
support you in accessing your data.

You can login and download your data. Instructions are available here:

https://kalite.learningequality.org/


*Please note: Kolibri will continue to make Khan Academy videos and*
*exercises available, and this is unrelated.* 

Again, we strongly encourage you to download your data from the KA Lite
Central Server as it will no longer be available after March 1, 2020.
If you do require a similar central data syncing service, please contact
us via info@learningequality.org, so we can best assess your needs and
how we can support.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused as a result of this change,
but we strongly believe that the shift to Kolibri will better support
learners in the long-run. If you have any questions, we encourage you to
post in the relevant discussion pages on our Community Forum about
KA Lite and/or Kolibri:

With our warmest regards,
The Learning Equality team
