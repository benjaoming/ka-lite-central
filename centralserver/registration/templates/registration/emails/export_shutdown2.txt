Dear {{ name }},

You are receiving this reminder email, because you have a registered
account on KA Lite's "Central Server" or "Hub", a data syncing service
that is about to be discontinued. Please read on:

Since the launch of our second generation platform, Kolibri, in
December 2017, Learning Equality has stopped actively developing
KA Lite. While KA Lite is still available for use, we will be
discontinuing the ability to sync data to the KA Lite Central Server,
and are encouraging users to start the transition to Kolibri. This means
that any data you have on the KA Lite Central Server will no longer be
retrievable as of March 1, 2020.  

If you want access to this data, we strongly encourage you to retrieve
and export any data from your synced deployments by March 1, 2020. It
will not be available after this date, and we will not be able to
support you in accessing your data. You can login and download your
data. Instructions are available here:

https://kalite.learningequality.org/


* Please note that Kolibri will continue to make Khan Academy videos *
* and exercises available. *

As a reminder, KA Lite Central Server is the aggregated data from
multiple installations can be synced and stored and is being
discontinued. Please note that Kolibri will continue to make Khan
Academy videos and exercises available.

We hope that you will start considering and planning your transition to
Kolibri as well. Kolibri is built on years of lessons and feedback from
KA Lite. Beyond having feature parity and Khan Academy videos and
exercises, it also has a larger library of content, additional
pedagogical support to educators to support just-in-time pedagogy, and
tools for differentiated learning. And like KA Lite, it is free, Open
Source and available for use offline.

Central Server as it will no longer be available after March 1, 2020.

us via info@learningequality.org, so we can best assess your needs and

We apologize for any inconvenience caused as a result of this change,
but we strongly believe that the shift to Kolibri will better support
learners in the long-run. If you have any questions, we encourage you to
